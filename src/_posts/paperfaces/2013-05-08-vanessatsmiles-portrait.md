PaperFaces portrait of project donator [@VanessaTSmiles](https://twitter.com/VanessaTSmiles). First illustration done with the newly updated Paper for iOS app. Really like how zoom was implemented and the explore feature.

I also recorded my iPad's screen for this portrait that shows the new zoom tool in action. <del>Just have to edit the raw capture in Adobe AfterEffects and then post to YouTube. Should be up soonâ€¦</del>
