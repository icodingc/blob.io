After having so much fun creating and releasing [my first open source Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes), I figured I'd go at it again. So here be the fruit of that effort --- I call it [**So Simple**](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme), a simple Jekyll theme for words and pictures. 

- A variety of layouts with clean and readable typography.
- [Microformats](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) markup to make post content machine-readable and discoverable.
- Disqus Comments and Google Analytics support.
- SEO best practices via [Jekyll SEO Tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag).
- Options to customize the theme and make it your own.
