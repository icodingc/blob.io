Pretty much the only reason I created an About.me page was to get free customized business cards printed by Moo.

If you weren't aware --- [About.me](https://about.me) is a custom profile and personal analytics dashboard that lets you quickly build a personal page that points users to your content from around the web. Its straightforward WYSIWYG editor makes customizing the design, fonts, colors, and background image a breeze.

*[WYSIWYG]: What you see is what you get
