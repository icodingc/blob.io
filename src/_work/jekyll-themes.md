Below are all of the Jekyll starters I've developed and open sourced. Each theme contains all of the `_layouts`, `_includes`, Sass/CSS, JavaScript, and other sample files needed to build and host a site or blog. 

The basic setup for each of my theme's is roughly the same:

  1. Install [gem-based theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#understanding-gem-based-themes), [remote theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme), or fork the theme repository you'd like to use.
  2. [Install Bundler](http://bundler.io) `gem install bundler` and run `bundle install` to install all dependencies (Jekyll, plugins, and so on).
  3. Update `_config.yml`, data files (found in `_data`), and replace sample posts and pages with your own.

For more specifics, review each theme's documentation by clicking on the **setup guide** buttons below.
